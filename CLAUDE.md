# CLAUDE.md — project memory & handoff

Read this first. It orients a Claude Code session on this repo and says where we are and what's
next. Deeper detail lives in `re/notes/` and `firmware/DESIGN.md`; this file is the index + status.

## What this project is
Reverse-engineering the shipped `.hex` firmware for the **Buchla-format 288r "Time Domain
Processor"** (Roman Filippov / Black Corporation clone of the Buchla 288), then building a
**community firmware** that fixes what the abandoned original never did. Vendor source was promised
but never released → we work from the binary. The owner has the unit **and an SWD/JTAG debugger**
(bench session pending, ~days out as of this writing).

**Primary goal:** make delay-time modulation **smooth** so the module can do chorus/flanger. The
stock firmware steps the delay in whole samples and changes delay time by retuning the audio PLL.

**Scope decision (locked): CLONE FIRST.** Faithfully reproduce the 288r's behavior/panel on a
better engine; add new features/controls/modulation only *after* the clone is nailed.

## Current status
- **RE: done.** Target = **STM32F429** (Cortex-M4F). Delay engine fully traced. See
  `re/notes/architecture.md` and `re/notes/delay-engine.md`.
- **Binary Patch 1: complete + statically verified** (not yet flashed) — `re/patches/`. Adds a
  fractional interpolated tap to the *stock* firmware via flash code-cave detours. Covers **both
  audio paths** (`sub_1968` + `sub_1c98`) and both `mode==6` recirc fetches — 6 detours, 184-B cave.
- **Community firmware engine: written + host-tested** — `firmware/src/` (delay_line, taps,
  time_control, transport, mixer, engine, envelope) + `firmware/test/` (5 suites). `make test` green;
  `make engine` cross-compiles for the F429 (~1.9 KB). Interpolation fidelity measured
  (`test_interp_quality.c`): Hermite ~2.4× better than linear at ½ Nyquist.
- **BLOCKED on the bench/SWD session** for a flashable image and exact constants (see below).
  The no-hardware DSP/patch work is essentially exhausted.

## Key technical facts
- MCU STM32F429, flash @ `0x08000000`, 192 KB SRAM (SP `0x20030000`), external **SDRAM delay buffer
  @ `0xC0000000`** via FMC. Audio = **SAI2** full-duplex + **DMA2 Stream1/Stream4**. ADC1/2/3 =
  CV/pots/trimmers. Stock image is 27,912 B.
- **Address mapping:** Binary Ninja `sub_X` (in `re/binja/`, loaded at base 0) == our flash address
  `0x08000000 + X`. Verified.
- **Two root causes of no chorus/flanger** (both confirmed in code):
  1. Read tap is integer — fractional distance truncated by `vcvt.s32.f32` @ `0x08001aa6`, single
     fetch `bank[wp-dist]` @ `0x08001ae8` in `sub_1968` (and twin `sub_1c98`).
  2. Coarse delay retunes the SAI PLL (`RCC 0x40023888/0x4002388c`) in octave steps w/ hysteresis.
- Control math in the stock fw uses **software double-precision** (`__aeabi_dadd/dmul/ddiv`) on a
  single-precision-HW FPU — the rewrite uses hardware single-precision float (efficiency win).

firmware/                     community firmware: DESIGN.md, src/, test/, Makefile, STM32F429.ld
```
Python tooling: `re/.venv` (capstone). Keystone won't load on arm64 → assemble patches with
`arm-none-eabi-as`. `.venv/` and build outputs are gitignored.

## How to build / test / verify
```bash
cd firmware && make test     # host unit tests (all pass)
cd firmware && make engine   # cross-compile engine for STM32F429
re/.venv/bin/python re/scripts/apply_patch1.py   # (re)generate + verify Patch 1 -> re/patches/patched.hex
```

## What's next
**Blocked until the bench/SWD session** (needs the board): CubeMX HAL from the confirmed pinout,
exact F429 variant + SDRAM size, codec part/format, clock tree/base rate, and calibration constants
(TIME taper, cycle-length sample counts, slider gain law, AUTO CONTROL, pulse thresholds). All are
`TODO(bench)`/`TODO(cube)` markers in `firmware/src/main.c` + `STM32F429.ld`; full list in
`firmware/README.md` "Blocked on hardware".

**Doable now without hardware (mostly done):** ✅ Patch 1 both paths + mode6, ✅ one-pole envelope
followers, ✅ interp-quality measurement. Remaining optional/speculative: an all-pass fractional
interpolation option (good for flanger, but its modulation transients can't be A/B'd without audio
hardware — defer to bench), and more host tests. Further substantive progress needs the board.

**When the bench session happens:** flash `re/patches/patched.hex`, breakpoint `0x08001aa6`, confirm
the read pointer stair-steps on the stock fw and is continuous after the patch; then start
`firmware/cube/` and calibrate constants against the real panel.

## Conventions
- Clone-first; don't invent precise constants — parameterize and mark `calibrate on hardware`.
- Keep `Compiled FW/B288-REV1.0.hex` untouched (golden). BOOT0 ROM bootloader is the recovery path.
- Attribution: `re/binja/` analysis is @Mixcatonic's (see README Credits) — preserve it.
- Personal machine notes for the original author live outside the repo (`~/.claude/.../memory/`);
  this file is the shared, in-repo handoff.
